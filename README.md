# E-commerce Database

## Description
This week's project is to build the back end for an e-commerce site, configuring the Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Multiple API Routes are set up to Perform RESTful CRUD Operations: read all categories, products and tags;
read a single category; product and tag; create a category, product and tag; update a category, product and tag; delete a category, product and tag. 

The returned products have assosicated category and tag data; the returned categories have associated product data; the returned tags have assosicated product data.
